Duc Le aka Duc Asimo is not student from any technology school/college. Have no idea why he tried his best for learning python language. Love lifting, spending time with his family, likes playing video games, and joined a dozen of non-profit translation projects. May be he thought coding with help him make something more useful? Hope he's doing well because his people start thinking he is out of his mind. Feel free to contact him at: duyduc100@gmail.com
