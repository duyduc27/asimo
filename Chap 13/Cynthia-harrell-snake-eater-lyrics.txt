[Verse]
What a thrill
With darkness and silence through the night
What a thrill
I'm searching and I'll melt into you
What a fear in my heart
But you're so supreme!

[Chorus]
I give my life, not for honor, but for you (Snake Eater)
In my time, there'll be no one else
Crime, it's the way I fly to you (Snake Eater)
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater

[Bridge]
Someday you go through the rain
And someday you feed on a tree frog
It's ordeal, the trial to survive
For the day we see new light

[Chorus]
I give my life, not for honor, but for you (Snake Eater)
In my time, there'll be no one else
Crime, it's the way I fly to you (Snake Eater)
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater
(Snake Eater...)
